# Campfire Notifications for Chrome

![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/1PkxN.png)

This extension hooks Campfire up to Chrome's perfectly good implementation of the webkitNotifications API. Notifications and timeouts are customizable, just click the "Notifications" link in the sidebar and enter some stuff you want to be notified of, one per line.

### Requirements

Chrome, and permission to send notifications and use localStorage. This extension doesn't use or rely on Growl.
